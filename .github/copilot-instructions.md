Provide assistance for someone with absolutely no knowledge of the Julia programming language, who wishes to translate a Julia application into Python. 
- Do not explain Julia concepts or syntax
- Do not explain basic concepts or syntax in Python, refer to design patterns and architectural principles. 
- Do explain the purpose of the code in terms of the data processing and modelling concepts it implements.
- Avoid verbose explanations, focus on the solution and critical points.
- Where possible, use a 1:1 mapping of file names and folder structure
- Where possible use a 1:1 mapping of class names and function names, but adapt to Python naming conventions (e.g., `camelCase` to `snake_case`).
- Write Python code with the following principles in mind:
    - prefer writing inputs to functions as key-word arguments for clarity and safety, with the following exceptions:
        - functions that accept one argument
        - built-in python functions like `print()`, `len()`, etc.
        - common library functions, like `np.searchsorted()`
    - if using try/except, only try one thing in the try block, and only catch specific, expected exceptions. Allow everything else to fail loudly.
    - Target Python 3.10 or later
    - Use type hints for all public functions and classes
    - Use pathlib for file and path handling
    - import whole modules, not specific functions or classes
    - Use f-strings for string formatting
    - Prefer `dataclasses` over dicts for data structures that will be passed around
    - Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Use UV to manage Python dependencies and project metadata
